2. Look for the latest release. You will see files listed under the version number. 

3. Click on the desired file to download it. For a typical setup, choose the JAR file named like `ChaTop-1.0.0.jar`.

4. After downloading, locate the file on your computer.

5. Open your terminal or command prompt:

   - On Windows, you can do this by searching for ‚Äúcmd‚Äù in the Start menu.
   - On macOS/Linux, use the terminal application.

6. Navigate to the folder where you saved the JAR file. Use the command:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/downloaded/file
   ```
   Replace `path/to/your/downloaded/file` with the actual path.

7. To run ChaTop, use the following command:
   ```bash
   java -jar ChaTop-1.0.0.jar
   ```
   This will start the application, and you will see some output in your terminal.

8. ChaTop will be running locally. By default, it uses the port **8080**. You can access it by going to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## üîç Explore the API

Once ChaTop is running, you have access to its APIs:

- **Authentication API:** Handle user login and registration.
- **Property Management API:** List, add, modify, or delete properties.
- **Messaging API:** Enable communication between users and property managers.

Information on how to use these APIs can be found in the [OpenAPI documentation](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You may want to configure your application settings before using ChaTop. Here's how:

1. Open the `application.properties` file located in the configuration directory after running the JAR.
2. Modify settings like database URL, username, and password for MySQL.

For example:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

After making changes, restart the application using the command mentioned above.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If you face issues while running ChaTop, consider these tips:

- **Java Not Found:** Ensure you have installed Java and added it to your system's PATH.
- **MySQL Connection Errors:** Verify that your database is running and the credentials in `application.properties` are correct.
- **Port Already in Use:** The default port **8080** may be taken by another app. You can change the port in the `application.properties` file.
